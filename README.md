# VB.NET
# Windows forms with Round Form design and rounded buttons

This is a slight variation from https://rjcodeadvance.com/ the original code does not seem to exist so this is my slight variation( I can't find it at least; giving where credit is due ).

I added a Nuget package to the project for smooth round button designs as everything I found seems do rely on redrawing the original buttons and adding radius/arcs was pixelated and or unevenly applied for smaller buttons.

Button Nuget Package: CButtonLib

The button will show up as a new section called CButton at the top of your choices as shown in the screenshot.
